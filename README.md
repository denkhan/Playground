# Playground
This is a project in Advanced interaction design MAMN01, Designvetenskaper, LTH. 

### What is Playground?
Playground is an app to help keeping an eye on your children at the playground. 
The app alarms the parent when children devices have moved further away than the allowed distance. 
The parent can also select a child from the list of registered devices, to use a compass like navigator 
with distance and direction to find the missing child.

### Attention!
The child devices are simulated. There is no central server for handling the communication and maintaining the accounts.
We have ten simulated accounts with usernames "child1" to "child10". The child devices are generated at the start with a fixed random 
positions relative to the user, except for our test child "Bob" who have a real-life fixed position.
